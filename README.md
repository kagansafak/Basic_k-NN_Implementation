# Basic_k-NN_Implementation

- This repository contains a basic k-NN algorithm that allows classification according to wine features. 
- The algorithm was written from scratch and the sklearn.neighbors.KNeighborsClassifier function was not used.
- After downloading the dataset in the repository to your computer and entering the relevant file path to the location specified in the code, the code will run without any problems.
- How the algorithm works, which metrics are used and what can be tested and how are explained in the comments within the code.
- The model allows us to test it by changing many parameters. In this way, by trying different model scenarios, the necessary inferences can be made for each scenario.
- Also in jupyter notebook there are sample outputs of codes for a single scenario. You can also find additional explanations as text.
